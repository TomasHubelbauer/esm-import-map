    <h1>ESM Import Map 2</h1>
    <p>
      This page demonstrates the following: HTML starts off with no import map
      script; a deferred script is encountered and it crafts an import map at
      runtime and places its script to the head of the DOM; another ES module is
      encountered and this one uses a bare specifier which is mapped in the map
      added previously. Will this work?
    </p>
    <script type="module">
      const script = document.createElement('script');
      script.type = 'importmap';
      script.text = JSON.stringify({ imports: { module: './module-c.js' } });
      document.head.append(script);

      setTimeout(
        () => {
          const script2 = document.createElement('script');
          script2.type = 'module';
          script2.text = `import test from 'module';`;
          document.head.append(script2);
        },
        0
      );
    </script>
    <p>
      Nooo, check the developer tools console! The dynamic import map is added
      to the DOM, and then the other script is added, but the developer tools
      show the error seen when no import map is found:
    </p>
    <q>
      The specifier “module” was a bare specifier, but was not remapped to
      anything.
    </q>
    <p>
      We can't even wait for the <code>load</code> event of the import map
      script because that even only fires for scripts with a <code>src</code>
      attribute - when their linked file downloads.
      Inline scripts don't have this behavior and we can't use a linked script,
      because then we'll run into the issue described on the main page where
      the <code>file:</code> protocol won't serve the right MIME type for the
      import map script file.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did try to check around this by using a timeout with up to a second long
      interval, but to no avail. The dynamically added import map is simply not
      respected.
